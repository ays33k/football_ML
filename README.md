## Project Title: **Player Tracking in Football Video Using YOLOv8 + IOU Matching**

---

### ✅ How to Set Up and Run the Code

1. Place the following files in the **same directory**:

   * `best.pt` (YOLOv8 model trained to detect: ball, goalkeeper, player, referee)
   * `15sec_input_720p.mp4` (input football video clip)

2. Run the complete Python script (`player_tracker.py`) on **Google Colab** or locally with the following environment setup.

3. The code will generate `output.mp4` as the final annotated video with player tracking and persistent IDs.

---

### ✅ Dependencies / Environment Requirements

* Python >= 3.8
* Packages:

  * `ultralytics`
  * `opencv-python-headless`
  * `numpy`

To install dependencies (Colab or local):

```bash
pip install ultralytics opencv-python-headless
```

# Brief Report (report.md)

## 📌 Approach and Methodology

* **Model**: We used the provided YOLOv8 `best.pt` model to detect four classes: `{0: ball, 1: goalkeeper, 2: player, 3: referee}`.
* **Tracking Logic**:

  * We detect only **class 2 = players**.
  * Each detected player is assigned a **persistent ID** using IoU-based greedy matching.
  * If a detection doesn’t match any existing track (IOU < 0.3), a **new track ID** is assigned.
  * Tracks are removed if missed for more than 5 frames.

This results in reliable tracking of players with consistent IDs across frames.

## 🔬 Techniques Tried and Their Outcomes

### ✅ Tried:

* **Naive IoU Tracker**: Simple and fast. Successfully assigns persistent IDs.
* **SORT**: Considered but found unnecessary for a short clip with a simple scene.
* **Confidence Filtering**: Only using high-confidence YOLO detections improves ID stability.

### ❌ Not Tried:

* Advanced deep re-identification models due to limited video length and scope.

## 🧱 Challenges Encountered

* **Class filtering**: Ensuring only players (class 2) are tracked.
* **Video backend compatibility**: Avoiding `cv2.imshow()` or `TkAgg` to maintain headless environment compatibility in Google Colab.
* **Model compatibility**: Ensuring proper loading of `best.pt` with `ultralytics` API.

---

## 🚧 What Remains / Next Steps

* **Improve Re-Identification Accuracy**:

  * IOU fails in player crossover or occlusion scenarios.
  * Using `SORT` or `DeepSORT` would improve ID consistency.

* **Trajectory Drawing**:

  * Future enhancement can visualize path history per player.

* **Speed Optimization**:

  * Use a smaller model or batch processing for longer clips.
